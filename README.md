# Earnings_Dates

This is a command line app written in python which you can use to check for upcoming earnings dates for all stocks from marketwatch.com. I was using python 3.7.9 for this project in VS code on Mac Os Monterey 12.0.1.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone <https://github.com/R34P3R44/Earnings-Dates.git>
```

2. Cd into the project folder.

Install packages for python;

```
pip3 install datetime
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install requests
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

3. Run python project in code editor or terminal;

- From editor, you should have a "play" button lookalike thingy somewhere

- From terminal run the following code:
```
 python3 GetEarningsDates.py
```
- From python IDLE, press fn + F5 on Mac.
